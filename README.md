Give your memory a boost with Newrons.

Newrons are smart glasses that offer a gentle memory assist by flashing a light in the wearer's peripheral vision when they are in the vicinity of an object associated with an event on their calendar.  For example, if the user has "Take Medicine" on their calendar at 2:00PM, and they are near a pill bottle around that time, a light on the glasses will flash to jog the wearer's memory.

This offers the advantage of reminding the wearer of something they need to do exactly when it is convenient to do so.  Smartphone notifications can often be dismissed and forgotten because they give an alert at a time when they are inconvenient or impossible to immediately act on.  It is also completely passive and doesn't require one to have their phone at hand.
